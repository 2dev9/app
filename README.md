* You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.


### Running unit tests

* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).






## Backend Development

* The source code for the backend is located in the `./server/` directory

* The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


### Running end-to-end tests

* Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
* Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve` or `npm run serve`.
